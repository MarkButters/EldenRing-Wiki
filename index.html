    <h2>Where I started</h2>
    <p>I started playing SoulsBorne games on the xbox with my first game being Dark souls, however i struggled with the tutorial of the game and wouldn't start playing these games again until Dark Souls 3.</p>
    <p>My friends actually got me to start playing Dark Souls 3 and I got hooked on the game and completed my first playthrough in the a couple of months from starting. </p>
